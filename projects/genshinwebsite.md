  This website features characters from the gacha game called "Genshin Impact". The links above are functional which takes you to the official Genshin Impact website. On the top left, it also toggles music that also derives from the game. All this was done by linking HMTL, CSS, and Javascript together without use of a framework using Visual Studio Code as an IDE. I've also customized a bit of the scroll bar as well to make it brown and a little rounded.

<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="800px" src="../img/micromouse/genshinwebsite2.png" class="img-thumbnail" >
  <img width="800px" src="../img/micromouse/genshinwebsite3.png" class="img-thumbnail" >
</div>

As you scroll over character boxes, the font dissapates and the silhouettes come to life. The respective character shows and is accompanied by their element type as their background. You get to see all different types of characters and there elements all seperated by their own region. So far I've only covered two regions. 

This website was not officially launched.
