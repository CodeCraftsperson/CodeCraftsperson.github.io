  This is one of a few lyric videos I created but is the only one I published. This video is bascially what the title says, it is a lyric video for the acoustic version of the song called "Starlight" from starset. I made this using Hitfilm express and had a fun time learning video editing. It helped sparked another passion in me for creative thinking and adaptability. It was my first time using Hitfilm express and I didn't have the best of PC hardware for things to process smoothly, in fact, it took quite a while to get things up and running, but the fact I had so much fun and developing a new interest was so exciting for me that even that it took a while to process everything, I perservered until I finished.

Here's the link to the lyric video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJH9_TQ24yI">"Starlight" by Starset</a>
