## Introduction <img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/difficulty/dancingcoding.jpg">
Artificial Intelligence (AI) transformed the various industries forever. Its impact on education, functionality, and efficiency across many different industries proves substantial. In the realm of education, especially in Software Engineering, AI technologies plays a pivotal role in enhancing learning experiences, personalizing education, and providing innovate solutions to both short and long-standing challenges. As techonology continues to evolve and so does the relevance and potential of AI integration, it not only helps prepares students for rapidly changing landscape in Software Engineering, but also introduces approaches to problem-solving and software development. 

The main AI tool I've used for Software Engineering is ChatGPT. ChatGPT is designed to assist users in generating human-like text based on the input provided from the user and is able to efficiently solve many problems thanks to its expansive database that it uses for reference. Especially in code development, ChatGPT helped me get a gist of what could be wrong with my code, providing valuable information that I can gather and then use to solve the problem. With the use of ChatGPT, not only was I able to solve problems, but I was also able to learn why the problem came to be, how I could prevent it from happening in the future, and how it can be solved. AI tools are amibigous in giving the user both the answer and an explanation. The integration of AI in education in particular courses such as Software Engineering is a promising avenue for fostering innovation and preparing students for the dynamic fields of software development. The use of AI tools such as ChatGPT and other relevant technologies can enhance the learning journey for everyone.
 

## Personal Experience with AI <img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/difficulty/javascript.jpg">
1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
- I have not used any AI tools to do the experience WODS. I thought it was important, especially for the experience WODS to learn and answer on my own.
2. In-class Practice WODs
- I have not used any AI tools to do in-class practice WODS. Since it was a practice WOD, I thought it would be best to learn on my own without the use of AI since nothing is at stake.
3. In-class WODs
- I've used ChatGPT on the final WOD. For the question "If the subscription is not ready, then what might happen when line 20 is executed?", where I copy and pasted both this quote and the code that was provided in the prompt. ChatGPT was able to accurately determine what would happen when line 20 is executed given the condition. From there, I understood what would happen, and was able to put what was outputted on the console into the document from my own understanding.

5. Final project
- I currently have not used any AI tools for the final project. Since I use in-class videos that are typically used in WODS which typically help me in doing the work, I didnt use AI as of yet.  
6. Learning a concept / tutorial
- I have not used any AI tools in learning a concept. For learning a concept, lessons that are taught on the websites suffice for the assignments and projects and therefore have not used it so far for learning concepts.
7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
- I have not used any AI tools in answering a question in class or in Discord typically because I do not ask questions in class or discord.
8. Asking or answering a smart-question
- I have not used any AI tools in asking or answering a smart-question. I am able to formulate the words in my head where it would suffice to be posted in the smart-questions channel so I thought the use of AI wouldn't be necessary.
9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
- I've used ChatGPT for one of the "Five problems every software engineer should be able to solve" where the problem was to write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. I've literally copy and pasted this text in ChatGPT: "Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. As an example, here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34." where ChatGPT was able to output the code in Javascript. From there, I understood the code and implemented into my assignment.
10. Explaining code
11. Writing code
12. Documenting code
13. Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”
14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed

## Impact on Learning and Understanding <img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/difficulty/athletic.jpg">

Amidst our dance in the spotlight, I can't help but to notice the tension that fills around the room. A crowd is gathering, and we are put on the spot. Usually we are alone together, but this feeling… It's like an all or nothing performance. Is this what they call athletic software engineering? I'm still new to the “on the spot” performances and truth be told, it does make me nervous, even a little stressed, but I know this will help me grow. The crowd may be small now, but I will continue to refine and perfect this dance so that when the world needs to see me, I can deliver on the big stage and make proud of those who count on me to get the job done. From my standpoint, athletic software engineering is a valuable practice. It sharpens problem-solving skills akin to athletes' training, driving continuous improvement. Just as athletes innovate techniques, coding gains efficiency. The competitive nature sparks creativity and fosters teamwork, vital in both fields. Adapting an athletic mindset enhances resilience to challenges, promoting personal growth.
