## Where did my interest in Software Engineering begin? <img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/difficulty/firststep.jpg">

I've always admired the harmony that some websites were to bring out. The availability that you are able to place in music, data, pictures, colors, and have full control on whatever goes on the website. The bliss that I know I would feel if I were to design a well running website like that and think "Wow, I made that". To name just one out of many, a website I've admired would be things like genshin impact; The Genshin Impact website stands as a testament to exemplary front-end development. Its seamless user interface, fluid animations, and visually stunning design create an immersive experience that mirrors the game's enchanting world. The website's responsiveness and attention to detail showcase a mastery of front-end techniques, anyone who would gaze on it would know to appreciate it. Although it may not be the first reason I was interested in software engineering, it is one reason I like front-end development. Eventually, this interest would bleed into not only just making websites, but to understand and appreciate that software engineering is made to solve problems. To know that you can accomplish many local and world problems through code. Thats when I eventually picked up a computer science class and the rest is history.

## My journey in this field so far <img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/difficulty/climbing.jpg">

I have to admit, learning to keep up with todays competitve tech market is very daunting as technology changes everyday and you think "Am I studying the right thing?" or "Is this language still prevalent compared to others?". First getting into this field, I would naturally feel very behind, but that didn't stop me from pursuing excellence in my studies. Initially, I had a D in my first main coding class and felt defeated. I knew every night that I was struggling and couldn't grasp why I wasn't understanding at the time. The next semester comes and I retake the same class, passing with an A. Then comes ICS 141, then eventually 211, and next thing I knew, I forgot about the tears I shed those nights in my first coding class because I was too proud of how I started and how I've progressed now. Since then in my free time, I would develop mock websites and a few text based adventure codes. Although, I've never completed any of them, I was able to finish enough to know I had the capability to do great things. That is a feeling I know that won't go away as long as I push through the hard days and nights, to know that I'll feel satisfied with how much I've grown in terms of Software Engineering since then.

## What I want to accomplish in the Software Engineering world <img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/difficulty/websites.jpg">

My eyes are locked in on front-end development. In the captivating realm of front-end development, my mission is to conjure digital magic! I yearn to craft websites and web apps that not only dazzle the eye but dance with seamless functionality. With HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript as my trusty wands, I'll conjure responsive, pixel-perfect interfaces that adapt across many devices. Staying in tune with the latest design trends, ensuring users are not just satisfied, but absolutely thrilled with their online experiences. Ill use the skills I've learned in and outside of class to help solve problems in the form of websites and hope to impact the world through front-end development. Let's transform the web into an enchanting wonderland, where user interfaces are not just beautiful but bewitching and informative!
