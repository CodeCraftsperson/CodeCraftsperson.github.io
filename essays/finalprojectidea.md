## Overview

In every bustling university campus, the issue of lost and found items has long posed a challenge for students, staff, and administrators. The frequent misplacement of personal belongings, from textbooks to electronic devices, not only causes stress and inconvenience for individuals but also adds to the workload of the university's lost and found department. In an effort to streamline the process of reporting, identifying, and retrieving lost items, our proposed solution is a digital catalog website for the university. This online platform will serve as a centralized hub where users can efficiently report lost items, search for their missing belongings, and conveniently claim found items, ultimately simplifying the lost and found process, reducing administrative burdens, and reuniting owners with their possessions more effectively.

## Mockup page ideas

1. Landing page: Displays a sign in page, sign up page, recent or featured found items, a search bar for users to type in the item they are looking for, and a "Report a Lost Item" button.
2. Item found detail page: Displays a description as well as when and where it was found, tags, contact information from the user that found them. photo of the item, and a button for the visiting user to claim their lost item.
3. Item lost detail page: Displays a textbox for the user to describe their lost item, an optional photo, a textbox to show the date, time and where it was lost, and tags for organizing the item into proper categories so users have easy access to determine what item was found or lost.
4. User profile page: Allows users to view and edit their profile information. Displays a list of items they have reported as lost or found.
5. Admin dashboard: Acessible only by administrators, it displays a statistics about the number of lost and found items, claims, and resolutions. Allows administrators to maange reported items, including marking items as claimed or resolved.

## Use case ideas


Amidst our dance in the spotlight, I can't help but to notice the tension that fills around the room. A crowd is gathering, and we are put on the spot. Usually we are alone together, but this feeling… It's like an all or nothing performance. Is this what they call athletic software engineering? I'm still new to the “on the spot” performances and truth be told, it does make me nervous, even a little stressed, but I know this will help me grow. The crowd may be small now, but I will continue to refine and perfect this dance so that when the world needs to see me, I can deliver on the big stage and make proud of those who count on me to get the job done. From my standpoint, athletic software engineering is a valuable practice. It sharpens problem-solving skills akin to athletes' training, driving continuous improvement. Just as athletes innovate techniques, coding gains efficiency. The competitive nature sparks creativity and fosters teamwork, vital in both fields. Adapting an athletic mindset enhances resilience to challenges, promoting personal growth.
