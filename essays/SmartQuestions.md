## Why asking smart questions matter
  Asking smart questions is important in software engineering because it facilitates efficient problem-solving, reduces misunderstandings, and aids in producing innovative solutions through effective communication. Smart questions demonstrate a commitment to clarity, which is vital when navigating intricate landscapes of coding, architecture, and user requirements. Users who have accumulated knowledge of what makes a question "smart" ask well-researched and clear questions, it helps them get relevant and timely answers, saving time for both themselves and those who provide assistance. Moreover, it contributes to the overall quality of the platform's knowledge base, making it a valuable resource for developers facing similar challenges in the future. Smart questions demonstrate a commitment to learning and understanding, fostering a collaborative spirit that is essential in the software engineering community. This, in turn, accelerates individual and collective growth, enhances coding skills, and enables developers to make more informed decisions when building software solutions.

An example of a smart question can be found in places like Stack Overflow. One I have encountered asks the question "What does "use strict" do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it?" Along with the clear goal that the author seeks to pursue in the headline, they accompany it with detailed information that informs the reader the error that occurs in the environment they were in, informing us that they google searched of this occurrence beforehand but to no solution, and asking if it occurs in multiple environments. By informing us that they google researched this error beforehand, this establishes that the author is not being lazy and showing effort that they truly need this question to be answered. The same effort can be seen when they precisely indicate what environment the error occurred in, this helps guides responders to potential appropriate solutions to the specific case. Finally, by asking if this occurs in multiple environments, may help a large pool of readers who use different environments identify the cause and solution of the error. By asking this question, not only will it entice responders to proper answers for the authors own problem, he may have shot two birds with one stone by also helping others who may come across the same problem that occurs in other browsers. 

As you get past the authors post, comes the replies. The replies you get at this point depends on how well you formulated your smart question, and this person recieved many satisfying answers. In the most upvoted question, the responder is able to precisely indicate the source of the error and come with a solution tailored to the environment they are in. They provided a small batch of code how "strict mode" is properly used and sent links to further clarify the use of strict mode. They even said that strict mode is supported by all browsers because the author was thoughtful enough to think about it occurring in other places as well! Talk about being considerate!
