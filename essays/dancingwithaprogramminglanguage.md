## Dancing with Javascript

Javascript, oh what a whirlwind of a programming language! Having ventured into this realm, I find myself in a lively tango with this dynamic script. My journey began with building an interactive website that gives users an opportunity to explore and engage, a dance of buttons, functionality, and animations choreographed to perfection. Although I’ve yet to master our dance, each performance leaves me wanting more. I’ve heard about ES6. Our dance was short, but I'll learn to master each step, such as the ones that came before you.

## Javascript is worth learning

From an engineering perspective, JavaScript is a gem worth its weight in code. Its versatility is akin to having a toolbox that houses a plethora of dynamic instruments. This language holds the power to sculpt a simple webpage or to architect complex applications with seamless interactivity. The asynchronous nature of JavaScript, coupled with promises, reveals an engineering marvel. It's like juggling multiple tasks while keeping a smile on your face, never missing a beat. It's both an artist and an engineer, beautifully crafting user experiences while optimizing performance under the hood. Now I may be biased since I like to dwell in website development, but the simplicity and performance its able to install on a webpage makes me swoon.

## Athletic software engineering

Amidst our dance in the spotlight, I can't help but to notice the tension that fills around the room. A crowd is gathering, and we are put on the spot. Usually we are alone together, but this feeling… It's like an all or nothing performance. Is this what they call athletic software engineering? I'm still new to the “on the spot” performances and truth be told, it does make me nervous, even a little stressed, but I know this will help me grow. The crowd may be small now, but I will continue to refine and perfect this dance so that when the world needs to see me, I can deliver on the big stage and make proud of those who count on me to get the job done.

In my perspective, the concept of athletic software engineering holds immense value as a powerful practice. Just as athletes sculpt their bodies through rigorous training, engaging in software engineering with an athletic mindset allows for the sculpting of one's problem-solving abilities. The persistent drive required to excel in both realms fosters determination and an unwavering commitment to improvement. Moreover, just as athletes refine their techniques to achieve peak performance, software engineers can continuously refine their coding skills, leading to the creation of efficient and elegant solutions. The competitive spirit in athletic software engineering fuels innovation, pushing individuals to explore novel approaches and reach new heights in their coding endeavors. Furthermore, this practice nurtures teamwork and camaraderie, as collaboration is essential both on the field and in the world of software development. I am still new to this concept but I've learned that this is an important thing I must put up with in order to succeed on and off the spotlight.
