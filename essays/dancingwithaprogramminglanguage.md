## Dancing with Javascript <img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/difficulty/dancingcoding.jpg">

Javascript, oh what a whirlwind of a programming language! Having ventured into this realm, I find myself in a lively tango with this dynamic script. My journey began with building an interactive website that gives users an opportunity to explore and engage, a dance of buttons, functionality, and animations choreographed to perfection. Although I’ve yet to master our dance, each performance leaves me wanting more. I’ve heard about ES6. Our dance was short, but I'll learn to master each step, such as the ones that came before you.

## Javascript is worth learning <img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/difficulty/javascript.jpg">

From an engineering perspective, JavaScript is a gem worth its weight in code. Its versatility is akin to having a toolbox that houses a plethora of dynamic instruments. This language holds the power to sculpt a simple webpage or to architect complex applications with seamless interactivity. The asynchronous nature of JavaScript, coupled with promises, reveals an engineering marvel. It's like juggling multiple tasks while keeping a smile on your face, never missing a beat. It's both an artist and an engineer, beautifully crafting user experiences while optimizing performance under the hood. Now I may be biased since I like to dwell in website development, but the simplicity and performance its able to install on a webpage makes me swoon. Javascript are also capable of first-class functions. JavaScript's first-class functions are a boon as they allow functions to be treated like any other data type. This flexibility empowers developers to pass functions as arguments, return them from other functions, and assign them to variables, enabling elegant and dynamic coding patterns like callbacks, and event handling. I've yet to use it to its full potential, but its good to know its possible when its needed.

## Athletic software engineering <img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/difficulty/athletic.jpg">

Amidst our dance in the spotlight, I can't help but to notice the tension that fills around the room. A crowd is gathering, and we are put on the spot. Usually we are alone together, but this feeling… It's like an all or nothing performance. Is this what they call athletic software engineering? I'm still new to the “on the spot” performances and truth be told, it does make me nervous, even a little stressed, but I know this will help me grow. The crowd may be small now, but I will continue to refine and perfect this dance so that when the world needs to see me, I can deliver on the big stage and make proud of those who count on me to get the job done. From my standpoint, athletic software engineering is a valuable practice. It sharpens problem-solving skills akin to athletes' training, driving continuous improvement. Just as athletes innovate techniques, coding gains efficiency. The competitive nature sparks creativity and fosters teamwork, vital in both fields. Adapting an athletic mindset enhances resilience to challenges, promoting personal growth.
