## Designs patterns and dance choreograph are one in the same <img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/difficulty/ballerinadancing.jpg">

Design patterns dance onto the stage as choreographed routines in the symphony of software engineering, gracefully handling recurring problems with the elegance of a well-practiced ballet. These patterns are like well-seasoned dishes, offering a secret sauce for creating code that is not only functional but also enjoyable to maintain and grow. Consider them architectural blueprints, whispering tried-and-true answers into the ears of developers, producing a harmonious tune of flexibility and adaptability. They're the seasoned storytellers of code, offering tales of best practices and tried-and-true tactics, each pattern a character in the growing drama of software design. While these patterns offer a symphony of benefits, the virtuoso developer must wield them with care, conducting a performance tailored to the unique nuances of each project to avoid turning the codebase into a cacophony of unnecessary complexity. Such patterns are meant to be used, so then I chose to act.

Programming design patterns function in a similar manner to that of choreographies, were they can be evolved, scrapped, or maintained to preserve optimal techniques that would make software engineering projects more efficient to work on. Essentially, they serve as convenient labels for recurring actions that are simpler to name than to elaborate on each instance. These patterns embody optimal approaches refined over time by seasoned developers. While it's possible to develop software without a explicit awareness of prevalent patterns, they frequently manifest organically when addressing coding obstacles. Design patterns essentially represent widely accepted paradigms that many individuals unconsciously employ, even if they aren't formally acknowledged. Like you, I consistently incorporate design patterns into my work, with or without even knowing.

There are a quite a few instances that occurred during my code sessions where I think to myself "Wait a minute, something like this has to already have been done, and implemented optimally. I should look it up, understand, and incorporate into my code." In the realm of programming, design patterns offer standardized solutions to common challenges, contributing to more efficient and maintainable code. When working with JavaScript, leveraging built-in functions, such as javascript underline functions, often proves superior to reinventing the wheel with my own custom functions. The use of underlined functions not only aligns with established best practices but also takes advantage of the optimizations and efficiencies implemented by the language itself. For instance, rather than crafting a sorting algorithm, employing JavaScript's native Array.sort() function can lead to more streamlined and reliable results. Similarly, the use of underlined functions like map(), filter(), and reduce() can significantly enhance code readability and reduce the likelihood of errors, as these functions have been fine-tuned over time by the JavaScript community and are optimized for performance. Embracing these design patterns not only simplifies development but also creates a standardized and collaborative coding environment where software enigineers can easily understand.

## A lake is more beautiful than the ocean <img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/difficulty/lake.jpg">

Although design patterns prove beneficial, they should not be treated as absolute doctrine in software development. Misapplication in inappropriate scenarios can potentially impede progress rather than assist. Consider design patterns as tools and deploy them when relevant, avoiding their use for the sake of conformity. They are best employed when seeking solutions to specific problems. If you sense aspects of your code could benefit from simplification or enhancement, exploring and using various design patterns would prove beneficial if they offer viable solutions to the challenges you're encountering. Remember, just as too much rain can flood a river, excess of anything can be overwhelming. Be selective in your design patterns and you'll find that this lake you made is more beautiful than any ocean.
